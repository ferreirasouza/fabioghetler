#This is a mobile test automation portfolio#

Hi!

Welcome to my personal portfolio, I hope this can help you to set up your mobile automation for android and iOS using the same project.  

I have been working as a QA Analyst for the past 5 years, applying my knowledge in Software Testing for Mobile and Desktop.

My technology background is focused in mobile testing automation (Appium, AWS Device Farm, Git Hub and Jenkins) as well as other technologies such as UI Web Browser Desktop in CI-CD. 

The apk that is inside this project is only for test purposes, and it isn't functional.

Please, consider that I am not a Java developer,however I am a QA with a good knowledge of Java ;)
